# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 13 – Window Object + DOM Manipulation (🧩 Power to Control the Webpage!)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored two core concepts in JavaScript: the **Window Object** and **DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation**. These tools allow real-time changes to webpage structure, content, and style – the building blocks of dynamic user interfaces! 💡💻

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand the `window` object and its browser-specific properties  
- Learn the structure and function of the DOM  
- Select, modify, insert, and delete HTML elements dynamically  
- Build an interactive demo using DOM techniques  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **Window Object**:
  - `window.innerHeight`, `alert()`, `prompt()`, `confirm()`  
  - Acts as the global scope in browsers

- **DOM Basics**:
  - DOM is a tree-like representation of the HTML structure  
  - Enables JS-based access to and modification of HTML/CSS

- **DOM Selection Methods**:
  - `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()`  
  - `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` – modern and flexible options

- **DOM Properties**:
  - `.tagName`, `.innerText`, `.innerHTML`, `.textContent`  
  - Useful for getting/setting text and HTML content

- **DOM Attributes & Styling**:
  - `element.setAttribute('attr', 'value')`  
  - `element.style.property = 'value'` – inline style editing

- **Insert Elements**:
  - `append()`, `prepend()`, `before()`, `after()` – dynamic placement of elements

- **Delete Elements**:
  - `remove()` – instantly remove elements from DOM

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- DOM and Window Object give JavaScript the power to **interact with the webpage**  
- Selection and manipulation methods are key to real-time user experience  
- Inserting and removing elements programmatically adds interactivity  
- DOM control is essential for building modern, responsive apps ✨🧠

### 📁 Files:
- `Day13.html` – Page layout with interactive elements  
- `Day13.css` – Basic styling for UI elements  
- `Day13.js` – Full logic for DOM selection, manipulation, and styling  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JavaScript + HTML/CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Jump into **Events and Event Handling** – time to make web pages react to users! 🔄🖱️
