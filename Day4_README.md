Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎨 Day 4 – Starting with CSS: Colors and Backgrounds

📌 Today’s Focus:  
Diving into the basics of CSS — learning how to style elements using color and background properties and understanding the CSS color systems.

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Learn how to apply color and background styles using CSS
- Understand different ways to define colors: Named, HEX, RGB, and HSL
- Differentiate between inline, internal, and external CSS
- Create and link an external CSS file for cleaner structure

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:
- **CSS Color Property**: Using keywords, HEX codes (`#ff5733`), RGB (`rgb(255, 87, 51)`), and HSL (`hsl(9, 100%, 60%)`)
- **Background Property**: Setting solid background colors and experimenting with gradients
- **CSS Syntax**: Selectors, properties, and values
- **CSS Types**: Inline, internal (`<style>`), and external (`style.css`)
- **Linking CSS File**: Using `<link rel="stylesheet">` in HTML `<head>`

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- CSS allows complete visual control over HTML elements
- External CSS helps maintain separation of concerns for cleaner, scalable code
- Color systems like HEX, RGB, and HSL give flexibility in design
- Even simple styling makes a page more engaging and readable

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML & CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow's Plan:
Explore **text styling and font properties** in CSS — including `font-family`, `text-decoration`, `text-align`, and more!
