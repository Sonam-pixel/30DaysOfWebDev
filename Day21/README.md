# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎧 Day 21 – Recently Played, Trending & Charts Cards – Spotify Clone Visual Boost (📀📈)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I completed the Spotify Clone UI by implementing content sections like "Recently Played", "Trending Now Near You", and "Featured Charts". These were built using custom-designed music cards with consistent styling and responsive layouts. The interface now feels lively, engaging, and more Spotify-like! 🎵📲

### 🎯 Goals:

- Design and build music card UI blocks  
- Style image, title, and description elements for each card  
- Use flexbox to organize horizontal card scrolling  
- Maintain responsiveness with Bootstrap and custom CSS  
- Polish overall layout with consistent font and spacing  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- 🃏 **Card-Based Layouts:**  
  - Added three sections with headings: Recently Played, Trending, and Charts  
  - Each section contains multiple cards with cover image, title, and short description  
  - Used hover states and consistent card size for a clean look

- 🖼️ **Card Styling:**  
  - Cards have rounded image corners, spacing, and a dark theme  
  - Designed for mobile and desktop with wrapping behavior using Flexbox  
  - Maintained visual balance between padding and layout alignment

- 📱 **Responsive Design:**  
  - Ensured cards wrap on smaller screens while staying scrollable on larger ones  
  - Continued using Bootstrap 5 grid and custom media queries  
  - Added flexible widths and ensured consistent visual proportions

- 🖋️ **Typography + Theming:**  
  - Continued using Montserrat Google Font  
  - Kept title, info text, and padding consistent with earlier sidebar and nav styles  
  - Maintained Spotify-inspired aesthetic using `#232323` and `#121212` dark tones

- 🧩 **Component Reuse:**  
  - Structured reusable `.card` and `.card-container` classes  
  - Cards will easily scale when more content (like playlists) is dynamically added

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- Flexbox and consistent card dimensions are key to scalable layout design  
- Wrapping behavior must be tested across screen sizes early  
- Reusable components save time for future dynamic integration  
- Visual content makes the app feel alive even before functionality is added  
- Naming classes clearly helps in managing multiple card sections

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- HTML + CSS  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Font Awesome 6  
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:

From tomorrow, I will begin with building mini projects using JavaSCript ! 🎵▶️
