## 🎨 Day 29 – CSS Styling & JavaScript Logic Implemented! (🌐✨)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
Brought life to my **Personal Portfolio Website** by adding sleek **CSS styling** and **JavaScript interactions**. From static layout to dynamic and polished UI – it’s finally starting to feel like a real portfolio! 💼🚀

### 🎯 Goals:

### ✅ What I Worked On:

#### 🎨 CSS Styling:
- Applied a minimal, light-themed color palette with green highlights  
- Styled header, nav, and all major sections consistently  
- Used Flexbox for layout of skills, project cards, and responsive content  
- Designed attractive **project cards** with box shadows, hover transitions, and smooth rounding  
- Improved visual hierarchy with font sizes, spacing, and contrast  
- Styled scroll-to-top button for better user experience  

#### ⚙️ JavaScript Logic:
- Implemented **typing effect** to dynamically show roles like “Web Developer”, “UI Designer”, etc.  
- Enabled **scroll detection** to reveal or hide the scroll-to-top button  
- Added **smooth scroll behavior** for internal navigation clicks  
- Prepared foundation for light/dark theme toggle in next phase
