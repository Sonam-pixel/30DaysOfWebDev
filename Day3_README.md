# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧱 Day 3 – Completed HTML Fundamentals

📌 Today’s Focus:  
Wrapping up the complete HTML module by learning the remaining foundational concepts and applying them in mini web pages.

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand and implement semantic HTML for structure and meaning
- Learn and use HTML form elements and attributes
- Improve accessibility and follow best practices
- Finalize my foundation in HTML before moving on to CSS

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:
- Semantic Tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`
- Form Elements: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`
- Attributes: id, name, for, placeholder, required, alt, etc.
- Comments: `<!-- -->`
- Entities: `&copy;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&nbsp;`
- Nesting rules and best practices
- Accessibility tips (label/input association, alt text)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Semantic HTML makes content more understandable for both users and search engines
- Form elements are essential for user input and interaction
- HTML attributes and nesting play a key role in clean, maintainable code
- Accessibility is not just an option — it's a responsibility
