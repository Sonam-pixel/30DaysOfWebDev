# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 16 – Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript (🔁 Control the Flow)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored how JavaScript handles **task execution** using synchronous and asynchronous patterns. Mastering the event loop, callbacks, promises, and async/await is crucial for building responsive, non-blocking web applications. 🧠⚙️

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand synchronous execution in JavaScript  
- Learn how asynchronous code works and why it's used  
- Use callbacks and identify callback hell  
- Work with promises using `.then()` and `.catch()`  
- Implement `async/await` for clean async flow  
- Apply error handling in asynchronous logic  
- Use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **Synchronous JavaScript**:  
  - Code runs line-by-line  
  - Blocks execution until tasks complete

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**:  
  - Executes non-blocking operations  
  - Uses callback queue and event loop

- **Callbacks**:  
  - Passed as arguments to other functions  
  - Resulted in nested structures aka "callback hell" 😵

- **Promises**:  
  - Represent future values: `Pending`, `Resolved`, `Rejected`  
  - Handled using `.then()` and `.catch()`

- **Async/Await**:  
  - Cleaner syntax for async code  
  - Used `try...catch` for error handling

- **The Event Loop**:  
  - Manages execution of async tasks  
  - Differentiates call stack vs. task queue

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**:  
  - Functions that run as soon as they are defined  
  - Used to wrap isolated async logic

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Async patterns allow smoother user experiences  
- Promises solve nested callback issues  
- `async/await` makes code more readable  
- Error handling is vital in async logic  
- IIFEs are handy for encapsulating logic and scope

### 📁 Files:
- `Day16.html` – Basic UI for async test  
- `Day16.css` – Minimal styling  
- `Day16.js` – Examples of callbacks, promises, async/await, IIFE, and error handling  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JavaScript + HTML/CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Understand and Practice Fetch API. 🧩🎨
