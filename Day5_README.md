## ✍️ Day 5 – CSS Typography and Advanced Selectors

📌 Today’s Focus:  
Learning how to control **text appearance** using font properties and exploring powerful **CSS selectors** to target elements more efficiently.

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Practice text styling properties like alignment, decoration, spacing, and font family  
- Understand and use different types of CSS selectors (universal, ID, class, descendant, sibling, child, and attribute selectors)  
- Apply these styles on a demo webpage to improve visual structure and control

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:
- **Text Properties**:
  - `text-align`: Align text (left, right, center, justify)  
  - `font-weight`: Light, bold, and numeric values  
  - `text-decoration`: Underline, overline, line-through, none  
  - `line-height`: Spacing between lines of text  
  - `letter-spacing`: Control character spacing  
  - `font-family`: Apply system/web fonts and fallbacks  

- **CSS Selectors**:
  - `*` – Universal selector  
  - `#id`, `.class` – Basic selectors  
  - `element element` – Descendant  
  - `element > element` – Child  
  - `element + element`, `element ~ element` – Sibling selectors  
  - `[attribute]` – Attribute selector  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Typography greatly impacts readability and user experience  
- Proper use of selectors ensures precise targeting and clean styling  
- Combining selectors with good structure gives full control of a page's layout  
- CSS is not just visual — it helps organize and scale styling for larger projects

---

### 📁 Files:
- Day2.html – demo webpage with text and list elements  
- Day5.css – External stylesheet with text styles and selector rules

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML & CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

---

### 📌 Tomorrow's Plan:
Begin working with the Pseudo elements, Inheritance, **CSS Box Model** and **layout techniques** using `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `width/height` and more!
