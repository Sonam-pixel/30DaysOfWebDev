Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 8 – CSS Flexbox & Animations (🎉 CSS Module Complete!)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
Mastering **Flexbox** for responsive layouts and **CSS Animations** to add motion and interactivity to UI elements. This marks the **completion of the full CSS module** in my frontend journey! 🥳

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Build layouts using Flexbox with alignment, spacing, and wrapping  
- Apply @keyframes and animation properties to add transitions and effects  
- Create a responsive and interactive UI layout  
- Combine hover effects and animations for smooth user interaction

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:
- **Flexbox Fundamentals**:
  - `display: flex` – Turns container into flex layout  
  - `flex-direction` – row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse  
  - `justify-content` – Align items horizontally  
  - `align-items` – Align items vertically  
  - `flex-wrap` – Wrap or not wrap items  
  - `align-content` – Spacing between rows when wrapping  
  - `align-self` – Custom alignment per item  
  - `flex` – Shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis  

- **CSS Animations**:
  - `@keyframes` – Define animation stages (0% to 100%)  
  - `animation-name`, `animation-duration`  
  - `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`  
  - `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`  
  - `animation` – Shorthand (e.g., `slideIn 2s ease-in 1s infinite alternate`)  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Flexbox simplifies responsive layout building with intuitive alignment and distribution tools  
- Animations help enhance UI with motion, transitions, and interactivity  
- Hover effects + animation create engaging and modern user experiences  
- Combining layout and animation helps in designing visually appealing and functional components
