## 📦 Day 12 – JavaScript Functions & Advanced Array Methods (⚙️ Logic & Functional Magic)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored **JavaScript functions** – the building blocks of reusable logic – and practiced using **arrow functions** for concise expressions. I also worked with advanced array methods like `filter()` and `reduce()` to process data effectively in a functional programming style. 🔁🧠

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand function declaration and usage  
- Practice arrow functions for cleaner syntax  
- Use `forEach()` for iteration  
- Apply `filter()` and `reduce()` to manipulate arrays  
- Build a mini Filter & Sum App  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **JavaScript Functions**:
  - Declaring functions using `function` keyword  
  - Calling and returning values from functions  
  - Using parameters and arguments

- **Arrow Functions (ES6)**:
  - Shorthand syntax for cleaner code  
  - Great for use with array methods

- **forEach Loop**:
  - Functional iteration over arrays

- **Array Methods**:
  - `filter()` – Select values based on a condition  
  - `reduce()` – Combine array values into a single result  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Functions make code modular, readable, and reusable  
- Arrow functions simplify callback-based logic  
- Array methods like `filter()` and `reduce()` are essential for real-world data processing  
- Building the **Filter & Sum App** helped reinforce how functions interact with array data

### 📁 Files:
- `Day12.html` – Simple input interface and layout  
- `Day12.css` – Clean, centered design  
- `Day12.js` – JavaScript logic using functions and array methods  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Work with DOM in JavaScript! 🧩📚
