# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Day 22 – Planning a JavaScript Game – Rock Paper Scissors (🪨📄✂️)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I took time today to **plan my next mini project** — an interactive **Rock Paper Scissors game** using JavaScript! I outlined the core functionality, UI layout, folder structure, and key JavaScript concepts I’ll be implementing. This is going to be my first full logic-based game and I’m excited to bring it to life with clean, simple UI and smooth interactivity!

### 🎯 Goals:

- Plan out core gameplay mechanics and flow  
- Break the project into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript parts  
- Sketch UI layout and interactivity  
- Finalize file structure and setup environment  
- Define DOM structure and scoring logic

---

### ✅ Topics I Planned:

- 🧠 **Game Logic Flow:**  
  - Player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors  
  - Computer randomly selects a move  
  - Determine win/loss/draw using conditional logic  
  - Update the score and display result after each round  
  - Enable repeated plays without refreshing the page

- 🎨 **UI/UX Design Blueprint:**  
  - Circular icons/buttons for user choice (🪨📄✂️)  
  - Scoreboard with live score for "You" and "Computer"  
  - Result text ("You Win!", "Computer Wins!", "It’s a Tie!")  
  - Button to “Pick your move” or start next round  
  - Use soft color tones (pink, violet, blue) and hover animations

- 📊 **JavaScript Features to Implement:**  
  - Use `addEventListener()` for button interactions  
  - Generate random computer choice using `Math.random()`  
  - Compare player and computer selections with `if-else` logic  
  - Update DOM elements dynamically (`innerText`, `querySelector`)  
  - Track scores using global variables

- 🧑‍🎨 **Styling & Responsiveness:**  
- Use Flexbox to center elements  
- Keep layout responsive for both mobile and desktop  
- Use Font Awesome for hand gesture icons  
- Apply consistent spacing, font (Montserrat), and visual hierarchy

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- Pre-planning the UI and logic helps reduce bugs during development  
- Keeping the logic simple and modular ensures better readability  
- A clear visual structure keeps the design user-friendly and minimal  
- Naming classes and variables ahead of time speeds up development  
- Scalable games start with strong foundations — even small games teach big lessons

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- HTML + CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Font Awesome 6  
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:

I’ll start coding the **Rock Paper Scissors game UI** and implement the **gameplay logic** using JavaScript. It’s game time! 🕹️💻
