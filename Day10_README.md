# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 10 – JavaScript Loops & Strings (🔁 Text & Repetition Mastery)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored JavaScript loops – the power to repeat efficiently – and strings, the foundation for working with text in the browser. These tools are essential for dynamic UI and data handling! 🔄📝

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Practice different types of JavaScript loops  
- Understand how loops iterate over arrays and objects  
- Explore string declarations and escape characters  
- Use common string methods for formatting and transformation  
- Build a mini project to format name lists using loops  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **JavaScript Loops**:
  - `for` – Traditional counter loop  
  - `while` – Runs as long as condition is `true`  
  - `do...while` – Executes at least once  
  - `for...of` – Iterates over array values  
  - `for...in` – Iterates over object keys  

- **JavaScript Strings**:
  - Declaring strings using `'single'`, `"double"`, and `` `template` ``  
  - Template literals – `` `Hello, ${name}` ``  
  - Escape characters – `\n`, `\'`, `\"`, `\\`  

- **String Methods**:
  - `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()` – Change case  
  - `trim()` – Remove whitespace  
  - `slice(start, end)` – Extract substring  
  - `concat()` – Combine strings  
  - `replace()` – Substitute text  
  - `charAt(index)` – Get character by index  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Loops simplify repetitive tasks and increase efficiency  
- String methods give fine control over text processing  
- Combining both enables powerful data formatting features  
- Building a Name List Formatter deepened my understanding of iterating and transforming user input  

---

### 📁 Files:
- `Day10.html` – Name formatter layout  
- `Day10.css` – Clean and simple styling  
- `Day10.js` – Loop-based logic for name formatting  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Work on Arrays in js, Looping over an array and all array methods! 🖱️✨
