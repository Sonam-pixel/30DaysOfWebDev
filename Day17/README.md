# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 17 – Fetch API, AJAX & JSON (📡 Communicating with Servers)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored how web browsers communicate with servers using HTTP requests. I learned about `AJAX`, the `Fetch API`, and working with `JSON` data – core concepts for creating dynamic, real-time, and interactive web applications. 🌐🔁

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand how browsers make HTTP requests
- Use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
- Learn and implement the modern Fetch API
- Understand request and response handling
- Parse and work with JSON data
- Handle errors and failed requests gracefully
- Build a mini project using live API data

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**:  
  - Fetch data without page reload  
  - Traditionally done using `XMLHttpRequest`  
  - Now mostly replaced by the Fetch API

- **Fetch API**:  
  - Modern native JS method to make HTTP requests  
  - Returns a `Promise`  
  - Used `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `async/await` for chaining and cleaner syntax

- **Request & Response**:  
  - `Request`: Includes URL, method, headers, body  
  - `Response`: Includes status, headers, body  
  - Parsed using `.json()`, checked using `.ok` and `.status`

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**:  
  - Lightweight format for data exchange  
  - Easily readable and writable  
  - Standard format between frontend and backend

- **.json() Method**:  
  - Converts raw JSON response into JavaScript object  
  - Essential after fetching data for rendering in the DOM

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to use Fetch API to make real-world HTTP requests  
- JSON is the key data format in API communication  
- Fetch returns a promise that must be handled asynchronously  
- Proper error handling makes apps more robust  
- Rendering API data dynamically into the DOM is a practical skill for frontend devs

### 📁 Files:
- `Day17.html` – Basic UI to display fetched user data  
- `Day17.css` – Light styling for data rendering  
- `Day17.js` – AJAX with fetch, handling JSON, DOM manipulation, error handling

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JavaScript + HTML/CSS  
- Fetch API  
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) (Mock API)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
From tomorrow, I will begin with building demo pages of famous websites using html and css !🛠️🌍
