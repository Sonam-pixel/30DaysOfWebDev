# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Day 24 – JavaScript Logic – Rock Paper Scissors Game (🪨📄✂️)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I implemented the **JavaScript functionality** to make my Rock, Paper, Scissors game fully interactive! Now the player can click a move, the computer randomly responds, results are calculated, and scores are updated live. 🧠⚡

---

### 🎯 Goals:

- Add interactivity with JavaScript  
- Generate computer’s random move  
- Compare player vs computer choices  
- Determine round result (win/lose/draw)  
- Update scoreboard and message area dynamically  

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- 🧠 **JavaScript Logic:**
  - Attached event listeners to player choice buttons  
  - Created `genCompChoice()` to randomly pick the computer's move  
  - Wrote `playGame()` to control game flow and logic  
  - Developed `showWinner()` and `drawGame()` to update results and styles  
  - Implemented score tracking and live DOM updates  

- 💬 **Dynamic UI Updates:**
  - Display round result messages with color changes  
  - Real-time score increase for user and computer  
  - Background color changes based on win/loss/draw

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- DOM manipulation helps update UI without reloading the page  
- `addEventListener()` allows easy interaction with user input  
- Conditional logic is essential for decision-making in games  
- Separating logic into functions makes code clean and maintainable  
- Using simple math (random numbers) creates unpredictability in games

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:

I’ll start with new project that contain HTML, CSS, JS! 🎮✨
