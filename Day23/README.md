# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Day 23 – UI Implementation – Rock Paper Scissors Game (🪨📄✂️)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I built the **HTML structure** and **styled the UI with CSS** for my Rock, Paper, Scissors game! The interface is now fully responsive and visually polished — ready to connect with JavaScript logic tomorrow. Let the game-building fun begin!

---

### 🎯 Goals:

- Create clean and semantic HTML layout  
- Build game sections: title, choices, scores, and results  
- Apply CSS for responsive and interactive design  
- Use Flexbox for layout alignment  
- Prepare everything for JavaScript integration

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- 🧱 **HTML Structure:**  
  - Game heading and title section  
  - Player choices section with Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, Scissors ✂️  
  - Scoreboard with "You" vs "Computer" points  
  - Result message display  
  - JS `<script>` tag added for future logic  

- 🎨 **CSS Styling & Layout:**  
  - Flexbox used to align and space elements  
  - Circular image buttons with border-radius  
  - Hover effect on choices with transitions  
  - Score styling with large fonts for readability  
  - Contrasted message area to highlight round results  
  - Mobile-friendly layout using media queries  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- Structuring HTML first gives clarity for styling and JS logic later  
- Flexbox makes layout management smooth and responsive  
- Small visual cues (like hover effects) enhance user experience  
- Planning UI early makes future coding efficient  
- Separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS) keeps the project organized

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:

I’ll add the **JavaScript logic** for:
- Event listeners on choice buttons  
- Random computer move generation  
- Win/lose/draw result comparison  
- Live score updates after each round  
Let’s bring the UI to life with logic and interactivity! 💻🔥
