# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 15 – JavaScript Objects & Classes (🧱 Organize Code Like a Pro)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored how to structure and reuse code efficiently using **JavaScript Objects and Classes**. These concepts are at the heart of object-oriented programming and help in building scalable, maintainable applications. 💡🛠️

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand the purpose and structure of JS Objects  
- Learn how to define and instantiate Classes  
- Use constructors and methods effectively  
- Implement inheritance and extend base functionality  
- Add error handling for robustness  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **JavaScript Objects**:
  - Store data as key-value pairs  
  - Created using object literals and accessed dynamically  

- **Classes in JavaScript**:
  - Define blueprints for objects using `class` keyword  
  - Create instances using `new` keyword  
  - Promote DRY and reusable code structure  

- **The constructor() Method**:
  - Runs automatically on object creation  
  - Used to set up initial values for object properties  

- **Inheritance & `extends`**:
  - Allows one class to inherit from another  
  - Promotes reusability and cleaner code hierarchy  

- **The `super()` Keyword**:
  - Calls the constructor of the parent class  
  - Used to pass values and access parent methods  

- **Error Handling**:
  - Used validation logic to check inputs  
  - Threw custom errors for invalid scenarios

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Objects model real-world data in an intuitive way  
- Classes offer an efficient way to create multiple objects  
- Inheritance promotes scalability and reuse  
- Error handling ensures safe and predictable behavior 🛡️

### 📁 Files:
- `Day15.html` – UI layout for user management  
- `Day15.css` – Clean and modern styling  
- `Day15.js` – Class definitions, inheritance logic, error handling  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JavaScript + HTML/CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Practice Callbacks, Promises & Async Await.🔁🔍
