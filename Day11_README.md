# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 11 – JavaScript Arrays & Array Methods (📚 Data Mastery with Lists)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored JavaScript arrays – a powerful way to store and manage lists – and practiced looping through them and applying various array methods to add, remove, slice, and display data. Arrays are essential for organizing and working with collections! 🧠🔢

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Learn how arrays work in JavaScript  
- Use different loop types to iterate through arrays  
- Practice core array methods  
- Build a small Array Looper App to apply concepts  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **JavaScript Arrays**:
  - Declaring arrays with square brackets: `[]`
  - Storing multiple data values in one variable
  - Arrays can hold numbers, strings, objects, etc.

- **Looping Over Arrays**:
  - `for` loop – Classic index-based iteration  
  - `for...of` – Iterate over values  
  - `forEach()` – Functional approach  
  - `while` loop – Until condition fails  

- **Array Methods**:
  - `push()` – Add item at end  
  - `pop()` – Remove last item  
  - `unshift()` – Add item at beginning  
  - `shift()` – Remove first item  
  - `slice(start, end)` – Copy part of array  
  - `splice(start, deleteCount, ...items)` – Modify array at index  
  - `concat()` – Combine two arrays  
  - `toString()` – Convert array to comma-separated string  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Arrays help manage collections of data efficiently  
- Looping techniques make it easy to process each item  
- Built-in methods allow flexible data manipulation  
- Creating a basic Array Looper App improved my understanding of real-time array changes  

---

### 📁 Files:
- `Day11.html` – Array looper layout  
- `Day11.css` – Simple, clean styling  
- `Day11.js` – Logic for pushing, popping, and displaying array  

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Work with Functions and Methods in JS! 🧩✨
