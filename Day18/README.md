## 🎧 Day 18 – Spotify Clone UI with Bootstrap (🎨 Layout, Sidebar & Player Setup)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I began building a **Spotify UI clone** using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal is to recreate the layout and visual style of Spotify’s web player – a real-world project that focuses on UI layout, component reuse, and responsiveness. 🎶📐

### 🎯 Goals:
- Set up project structure for the Spotify Clone  
- Understand and use Bootstrap layout system (Grid + Flex)  
- Design and style the sidebar navigation  
- Add library section with playlist placeholders  
- Plan and create the sticky top nav  
- Set up the footer player structure  
- Begin implementing player controls and progress bar

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **Project Setup**:  
  - Linked Bootstrap via CDN  
  - Created base HTML structure  
  - Organized folders for HTML, CSS, assets, and components  

- **Basic Layout with Bootstrap**:  
  - Used Bootstrap grid + flexbox utilities for responsive structure  
  - Divided page into sidebar, main content, and footer  

- **Sidebar Navigation**:  
  - Home, Search, and Library buttons with Bootstrap Icons  
  - Vertical menu layout using `d-flex flex-column` and spacing utilities  

- **Your Library Section**:  
  - Added scrollable playlist area  
  - Used Bootstrap overflow and height utilities  

- **Library Boxes**:  
  - Placeholder boxes using Bootstrap cards  
  - Styled to mimic Spotify’s look with shadows and hover effects  

- **Sticky Top Nav**:  
  - Planned sticky navigation using `sticky-top` class  
  - Reserved space for user controls (settings, avatar)  

- **Cards for Songs/Playlists**:  
  - Set up reusable song/playlist card components  
  - Implemented using Bootstrap `card`, `img-top`, and spacing classes  

- **Footer Line & Player Structure**:  
  - Divider line above player using border utilities  
  - Footer includes controls, track info, and progress bar  

- **Player Controls & Playback Bar**:

  - Progress bar created using Bootstrap `range` input

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Bootstrap drastically simplifies responsive layouts  
- Flexbox utilities (`d-flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`) are powerful for positioning  
- Designing a music player interface requires thoughtful structure  
- Planning components first makes the UI scalable and organized  
- Cloning real UIs builds deep understanding of spacing, sizing, and structure

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML + CSS  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Bootstrap Icons  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
