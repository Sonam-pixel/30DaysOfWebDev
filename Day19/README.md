## 🎧 Day 19 – Spotify Clone UI Foundation (📐 Flexbox Layout, Sidebar, and Footer Setup)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I continued building the **Spotify UI clone** and focused on finalizing the page’s structural layout. I used Flexbox to align the sidebar, main content, and the sticky footer player. The aim was to build a clean and responsive base for further components. 🎶🔧

### 🎯 Goals:
- Implement Flexbox layout for sidebar and content alignment  
- Fix the footer music player at the bottom  
- Apply Spotify-style dark theme  
- Set up reusable structure for future UI parts  
- Clean up typography and styling using Google Fonts  
- Prepare base for adding icons and interactivity  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **Page Structure with Flexbox**:  
  - Used `display: flex` to align sidebar and content horizontally  
  - Made the music player sticky using `position: fixed`  

- **Sidebar Implementation**:  
  - Created sidebar with Home and Search navigation  
  - Applied dark background and white text for Spotify feel  
  - Styled links using CSS (`a { text-decoration: none; color: #fff; }`)  

- **Main Content Placeholder**:  
  - Added `main-content` section for playlists, albums, etc.  
  - Applied rounded corners and `overflow: auto` for scrolling  

- **Sticky Music Player Footer**:  
  - Added `.music-player` with black background  
  - Fixed height to `72px` and full width  
  - Placeholder for controls, song info, and progress bar  

- **Typography & Aesthetics**:  
  - Integrated Google Fonts: Montserrat  
  - Optimized for clarity using `font-optical-sizing`, `font-weight`, and `font-style`  
  - Rounded corners across layout with `border-radius: 1rem`  

- **General Styling Cleanup**:  
  - Unified dark mode using consistent background colors  
  - Removed scrollbars by setting `overflow: hidden` on `body`  
  - Improved layout readability and spacing

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- A well-structured layout sets the foundation for scalable UI  
- Flexbox makes side-by-side alignment intuitive and clean  
- Sticky elements like the music player improve user experience  
- Planning components first helps avoid messy code later  
- Small styling details (padding, borders, font smoothing) bring polish to a project

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- HTML + CSS  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Google Fonts (Montserrat)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
I’ll continue developing the Spotify clone by adding icons (Font Awesome), designing playlist cards, and enhancing the bottom player with media controls! 🎧🎛️
