# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📦 Day 14 – Events & Event Handling in JavaScript (🖱️ Making Webpages Interactive)

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I explored how to make web pages **respond to user interactions** using JavaScript Events and Event Handling. Understanding how events work is crucial for building dynamic, responsive user interfaces. 💡🧠

---

### 🎯 Goals:
- Understand what JavaScript Events are  
- Learn how to add and remove Event Listeners  
- Explore the Event Object and its useful properties  
- Build a mini interactive event playground  

---

### ✅ Topics I Practiced:

- **JavaScript Events**:
  - Events represent user actions like `click`, `keydown`, `submit`, `mouseover`, etc.
  - Let us build **interactive** web pages

- **Event Handling**:
  - Attach handlers using `addEventListener(event, callback)`
  - Remove handlers using `removeEventListener(event, callback)`

- **The Event Object**:
  - Access `event.type`, `event.target`, `event.timeStamp`, etc.
  - Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop default form actions

- **Popular Event Types Explored**:
  - `click` – on button press  
  - `mouseover` / `mouseout` – hover effects  
  - `keydown` / `keyup` – keyboard input  
  - `submit` – form interaction  
  - `input` / `change` – dynamic input response  
  - `DOMContentLoaded` – trigger after HTML fully loads

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use named functions if you plan to remove listeners  
  - Use arrow functions for quick anonymous handlers  
  - Keep logic clean and readable for maintainability  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- **Events are how users talk to your webpage**  
- Event listeners are the backbone of interactivity  
- The `event` object provides context and control over user actions  
- Clean event handling = smoother UI and better UX! 🌟

### 📁 Files:
- `Day14.html` – Event Playground UI layout  
- `Day14.css` – Clean styling with hover box  
- `Day14.js` – All event listeners and logic inside

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JavaScript + HTML/CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Live Server Extension  
- Git & GitHub

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:
Explore Classes & Objects! 🧾✅
