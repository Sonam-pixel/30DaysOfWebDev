Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💻 Day 26 – WhatsApp Chat UI Clone: HTML + CSS Layout Completed! 🎨📱

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
I focused entirely on completing the **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** for my WhatsApp Web-style Chat UI Clone! The layout is now fully responsive and styled to resemble the real WhatsApp Web interface – clean, sharp, and user-friendly.

### 🎯 Goals:

- Complete HTML markup for the chat interface  
- Build a responsive Flexbox-based layout  
- Style all elements including contacts, chat area, input field, and buttons  
- Finalize structure for integrating JavaScript next

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- 🧱 **HTML Layout:**
  - Structured the full UI using semantic HTML elements  
  - Built sections for **Sidebar (Chats)** and **Chat Window**  
  - Added contacts – Alice, Bob, and Charlie – with event triggers for selection  

- 🎨 **CSS Styling:**
  - Styled the sidebar and main chat area using **Flexbox**  
  - Created hover effects, padding, margins, and UI consistency  
  - Styled sent and received message bubbles  
  - Designed the chat input field and send button for usability and aesthetics  
  - Ensured responsive behavior across different screen sizes  

- 🧑‍🎨 **UI Polish:**
  - Added a subtle placeholder when no contact is selected  
  - Used color palette similar to original WhatsApp Web  
  - Focused on clean spacing, neat typography, and intuitive layout
