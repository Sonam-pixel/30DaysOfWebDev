# 🚀 30-Day Web Development Challenge (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi! 👋 I'm continuing my 30-day challenge to improve my frontend web development skills and build real-world projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💻 Day 27 – WhatsApp Chat UI Clone: JavaScript Logic Integrated! 💬⚙️

📌 **Today’s Focus:**  
Today was all about breathing life into the static WhatsApp UI I built yesterday. I implemented **JavaScript logic** to dynamically render chat messages, handle contact selection, and allow sending messages in real-time – all powered by plain JS and DOM manipulation!

---

### 🎯 Goals:

- Implement contact selection and chat header update  
- Dynamically render conversations using DOM methods  
- Enable message sending with instant UI updates  
- Improve UX with placeholder management and scroll-to-bottom behavior  

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- 🧠 **JavaScript Logic:**
  - Created a `chatData` object to store conversations for Alice, Bob, and Charlie  
  - Developed the `selectContact(name)` function to load a contact’s chat and enable inputs  
  - Implemented the `renderChat()` function to dynamically populate message bubbles based on the sender  
  - Wrote the `sendMessage()` function to append messages and refresh the UI instantly  

- ⚙️ **DOM Manipulation & Interactions:**
  - Used `createElement()` and `appendChild()` for rendering chat messages  
  - Added real-time scroll-to-bottom logic to keep the latest messages in view  
  - Disabled input and send button until a contact is selected to guide user interaction  

- 📦 **UX Enhancements:**
  - Added message validation to prevent empty messages  
  - Used visual feedback for current contact name in the header  
  - Managed layout consistency for seamless interaction with the UI

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- How to manage simple state (`currentContact`) and reflect it on the DOM  
- Structuring data using JavaScript objects to simulate real-world messaging apps  
- Creating responsive UI updates with minimal but powerful JS logic  
- Importance of clean DOM updates for user-driven applications  
- Enhanced problem-solving for flow control and input validation

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (from previous day)  
- JavaScript (DOM API, event handling)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub  
- Live Server Extension  

---

### 📌 Tomorrow’s Plan:

- Start with a new project! 🎯
